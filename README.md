# ImmoEliza â€“ Real Estate Price Prediction (Belgium)

This project aims to predict the selling price of properties in Belgium using machine learning techniques.

## Project Description

This project explores various machine learning models to predict real estate prices in Belgium. The dataset includes features such as property type, location, size, and other relevant attributes.

### ðŸ“Š Models Tried

| Model                       | Notes                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linear Regression**       | Simple baseline, interpretable but underperforms                  |
| **Ridge Regression**        | Performs well with regularization, reduced overfitting            |
| **Lasso Regression**        | Too slow to train on full dataset, not used in final selection    |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | Strong performance but prone to **overfitting** on this dataset   |
| **XGBoost Regressor**       | Best generalization, handled non-linear relationships effectively |

### ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

**RÂ² Score**: Measures how well the model explains the variation in the `price`. A value closer to 1 indicates better performance.

**MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Represents the average size of the errors in the predictions, regardless of direction.

**RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Calculates the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values, giving more weight to larger errors.

## Installation
